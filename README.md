# Data Mining: Eclat Frequent Itemset Mining
**Implementation of the Apriori and Eclat algorithms, one of the best-known basic algorithms for mining frequent item sets in a set of transactions, implementation in Python.**

## Implementaions
* Eclat Algorithm (pyECLAT)
* Eclat algorithm (buil a function & use trie node)

## Requirements
* Python 3.8.11

## Dataset
* Market Basket Analysis is one of the key techniques used by large retailers to uncover associations between items. It works by looking for combinations of items that occur together frequently in transactions. To put it another way, it allows retailers to identify relationships between the items that people buy.

* Association Rules are widely used to analyze retail basket or transaction data and are intended to identify strong rules discovered in transaction data using measures of interestingness, based on the concept of strong rules.

* The dataset has 998 rows of the purchase orders of people from the grocery stores. These orders can be analysed and association rules can be generated using Market Basket Analysis by algorithms like Apriori Algorithm.
